                The book is about the 15 year old Miguel Carlos Octavio Pablo de Cervantes, who is living with his
                grandmother
                in San Jacinto, Mexico. He’s got a sister, Elena, 12 years old. The father migrated to
                America years ago and the dream of them (he and his sister) is to follow their dad and live in America.
                They waited for years until the dad would send for them and then, finally, the father sent for Miguel,
                so Miguel started his journey across la linea. His sister, Elena, followed him, since she didn't want to
                wait even longer to get to America.
                On the way, they met Javi, an older father of a family who also wants to get into the USA. All in all,
                there wasn't one antagonist, although there was one person who was evil, but not throughout the complete
                story, namely Morales, a corrupt official.
