            Many people leave Mexico, because they hope that theyâ€™ll get a (better) job in another
            country. Most of them fled to California and Texas. In recent years, the mexican
            immigrant population shrunk from 2010 to 2017 by ~300.000, although many people still
            migrated to the US. Los Angeles has a mexican population of ~13%. Although they got to
            the USA, 21% of all Mexican immigrants are living in poverty in America as well (native
            born: 9%). Most immigrations were financed by relatives or families (~63%). 37% of the
            Mexican immigrants are uninsured (healthcare-wise), which is way more than the 7% of the
            native-borns.
