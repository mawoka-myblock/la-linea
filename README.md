# La Linea

This repo contains a website about the book, La Linea by Ann Jaramillo, which I created as part of a school project.

I just made it open-source, so anyone can learn or use it. This repo itself won't receive any big updates and i also
won't care about it anymore since the project is already over.

## Tech-Site

This website was made with Svelte, SvelteKit and TailwindCSS. It's deployed by Vercel. Want to modify it? Clone it, and
you'll figure the rest out yourself.
